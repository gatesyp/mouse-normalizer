# Tracker

## What is it? 

Eventually, a complete 'virus' that tracks every single thing I do on my computers. For now, it's a keylogger and mouse-movement logger. 

## Why? 

Because I want to track every single thing I do on my machines, and want to create useful applications based off that data. 

## Like what data? 

Mouse movements and keys pressed at first. Later, I will add things like programs opened, which screen is being currently viewed, and for how long. 

## What useful applications can you build based off that data? 

A tuned autocomplete function (like a smartphone's keyboard having autopredict), have certain applications be open before I think I want to open them, detect inefficiences and suggest improvements in my typing/navigation, 'autocomplete' and 'predict' mouse movements (instead of dragging all the way to top right corner of screen to exit a program, it will 'autocomplete' and jump ahead), mouse normalization for Parkinson patients.....  

## Wouldn't this invade privacy? 

Yup! The delivery method is quite cumbersome, so I doubt deploying this against other people would work.
